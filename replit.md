## Overview

This repository has been transformed from a Go development environment to a professional LaTeX document generation workspace. The primary focus is now on creating high-quality business strategy documents using LaTeX templates with professional formatting and comprehensive structure suitable for executive presentations.

## System Architecture

The repository is now a comprehensive LaTeX document generation system designed for creating professional business strategy documents. The architecture focuses on template-based document generation with professional formatting and comprehensive content structure.

### Current Structure:
- **Language**: LaTeX (TeX Live distribution)
- **Platform**: Linux AMD64
- **Build System**: PDFLaTeX compilation with custom scripts
- **Document Type**: Professional business strategy templates

## Key Components

The repository now contains:

1. **LaTeX Templates**:
   - `strategy_template_simple.tex` - Complete professional strategy document template
   - `strategy_template.tex` - Advanced template (requires additional packages)
   - Professional formatting with custom colors and styling

2. **Compilation Scripts**:
   - `compile_simple.sh` - Automated compilation script for the simple template
   - `compile_strategy.sh` - Compilation script for the advanced template
   - Automated PDF generation and cleanup processes

3. **Generated Documents**:
   - `strategy_template_simple.pdf` - Professional 10-page strategy document
   - Complete table of contents, executive summary, and business sections

4. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Comprehensive usage instructions and customization guide
   - Template features, requirements, and troubleshooting information

## Data Flow

Based on the telemetry data, the development workflow includes:
- Regular Go compilation activities
- Module dependency management
- Build cache operations
- Environment queries and version checks

## External Dependencies

The telemetry indicates potential use of:
- Go modules for dependency management
- Build cache system for compilation optimization
- Standard Go toolchain components (compiler, assembler, linker)

## Deployment Strategy

No deployment strategy is currently defined in the repository. The telemetry suggests this is primarily a development environment rather than a production-ready application.

## Changelog

## Development Notes

The repository appears to be in the initial setup phase for a Go project. The extensive telemetry data suggests active development work with:
- Regular compilation cycles
- Module management operations
- Build system optimization through caching
- Cross-platform development considerations (Linux AMD64 target)

Future development should focus on:
1. Adding actual application source code
2. Defining project structure and architecture
3. Implementing core functionality
4. Adding configuration management
5. Setting up deployment pipeline
